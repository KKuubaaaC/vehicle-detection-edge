Optimization Strategies
Hyperparameter Tuning

Learning Rate: Test range [1e-5, 1e-2] using grid search
Batch Size: Increase to 32 or 64 if GPU memory allows
Image Size: Try 416x416 or 512x512 for better accuracy
Loss Weights: Adjust alpha and beta based on validation metrics
Dropout: Increase to 0.5 if overfitting occurs

Performance Optimization

Mixed Precision Training: Use torch.cuda.amp for 2x speedup
Gradient Accumulation: Simulate larger batch sizes
Data Loading: Increase num_workers, enable pin_memory
Model Pruning: Remove redundant channels for faster inference

Training Techniques

Warmup Learning Rate: Gradual LR increase in first few epochs
Cosine Annealing: Alternative to ReduceLROnPlateau
Test Time Augmentation: Multiple predictions with augmentations
Model Ensemble: Average predictions from multiple checkpoints

Troubleshooting
Out of Memory Errors
python# Reduce batch size
BATCH_SIZE = 8

# Reduce image size
IMAGE_SIZE = 224

# Clear CUDA cache
torch.cuda.empty_cache()

# Enable gradient checkpointing
Poor Detection Performance
python# Lower confidence threshold
threshold = 0.3

# Train longer
NUM_EPOCHS = 100

# Increase localization loss weight
alpha = 2.0

# Add data augmentation
Overfitting Issues
python# Increase dropout
dropout = 0.5

# Add weight decay
weight_decay = 1e-3

# Reduce model complexity
# Use MobileNetV3-Small instead of V2

# Enable early stopping
patience = 10
Slow Training
python# Increase num_workers
num_workers = 4

# Enable pin_memory
pin_memory = True

# Use mixed precision
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler

# Reduce logging frequency
if batch_idx % 50 == 0:  # Instead of 20
Production Deployment
Model Export
python# Export to TorchScript
traced_model = torch.jit.trace(model, example_input)
traced_model.save('model.pt')

# Export to ONNX
torch.onnx.export(model, example_input, 'model.onnx')
Inference Optimization
python# Enable inference mode
model.eval()
with torch.inference_mode():
    predictions = model(input_tensor)

# Batch inference
batch_predictions = model(batch_tensor)
